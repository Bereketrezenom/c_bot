SYSTEM STATUS CHECK:

1. Bot: WORKING - Check terminal for HTTP 200 responses
2. Firebase standalone: WORKING - Test passed
3. Dashboard Firebase: NOT CONNECTED - Check the issue

To test:
1. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin-ui/
2. Check if cases load
3. If error shows, check Django terminal for debug output

The bot is responding in Telegram (lines 33, 38 show successful messages).
The issue is only with the admin dashboard Firebase connection.

Try accessing the dashboard and let me know what you see.
