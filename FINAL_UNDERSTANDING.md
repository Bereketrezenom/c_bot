# What You Actually Want - Pure Telegram Bot System

## The Real Workflow:

### 1. User Starts Bot
User → "I need help with anxiety" 
Bot → Saves to Firebase, notifies ADMIN in Telegram

### 2. Admin Assignment (IN TELEGRAM!)
Admin sees: "New case #123 from user"
Admin types: `/assign 123 456` (case 123 to counselor 456)
Bot → Notifies counselor

### 3. Anonymous Chat
User → "Hello"
Bot → Forwards to counselor (shows as "Anonymous User")
Counselor → "Hi, how can I help?"
Bot → Forwards to user (shows as "Your Counselor")

### 4. Case Management
Counselor → `/close 123` 
Bot → Marks case as closed, saves to Firebase

✅ Bot structure
✅ User registration

### What You ACTUALLY Need:
✅ Telegram commands for admins (`/assign`, `/close`)
✅ Real-time notifications in Telegram
✅ Anonymous chat relay system
✅ Case management via Telegram commands

I'll implement:
1. **Telegram commands** for admins/counselors
2. **Notification system** when cases are created
3. **Anonymous chat relay**
4. **Assignment workflow** all in Telegram

You DON'T need the web dashboard - everything through Telegram!
