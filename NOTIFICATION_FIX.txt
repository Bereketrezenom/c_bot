NOTIFICATION FIXED!

The issue was that `bot.send_message()` is an async function that needs to be awaited.

I fixed it by wrapping it with `asyncio.run()`:

```python
asyncio.run(bot.send_message(
    chat_id=int(counselor_id),
    text=(...)
))
```

The code is now reloaded. Please:
1. Go to the dashboard
2. Assign a case to yourself (Becky)
3. You should now receive the notification in Telegram!

The warning you saw in the terminal is now fixed.
