# What You're Seeing

## The "Loading Every Second" Thing

You're seeing TWO different processes running:

### 1. TELEGRAM BOT (Normal Behavior!)
The logs showing requests every ~10 seconds are from your Telegram bot polling for updates.
This is NORMAL and CORRECT behavior!

- Bot polls Telegram servers every 10 seconds
- Waiting for users to send messages
- This is how Telegram bots work
- Don't stop this!

Example log (this is GOOD):
```
HTTP Request: POST https://api.telegram.org/bot8370908228.../getUpdates "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
```

---

### 2. DASHBOARD (What You're Looking At)

Your leader dashboard is here:
ðŸ‘‰ http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin-ui/

When you open it:
- You should see your cases from Firebase
- Cases like "i have imagination issue"
- You can assign counselors to them

---

## What Should I See in the Dashboard?

You should see:
- 3 cases total (from your Firebase)
- Case details with problem descriptions
- A dropdown to assign counselors
- "Assign Case" button for each case

---

## The Bot Logs Are Normal!

Those repeating logs? That's your bot working correctly!
- Every 10 seconds: Bot checks for new messages
- When someone sends a message: Bot responds
- This never stops (that's how bots work)

âœ… Don't worry about it!
