Your Dashboard is Working!

The API is now fixed. Please:

1. Refresh your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin-ui/
2. You should see your case: "please hel me" by user Becky

If you still see "Firebase not connected" error, try:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
- Clear browser cache

The backend is working correctly - the API returns cases successfully.

Your Bot and Dashboard are both running!
