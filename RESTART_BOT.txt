ðŸ”„ RESTART THE BOT!

To apply the changes:

1. Stop the current bot (CTRL+C in the bot terminal)
2. Start it again: venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py run_bot

Now:
- User sends /problem i am stressed â†’ Creates case
- User sends /problem i am weak â†’ Says "You already have a case!"
- User sends regular messages â†’ Goes to counselor as chat!

âœ… Fixed!
