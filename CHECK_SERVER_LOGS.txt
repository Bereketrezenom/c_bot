🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

1. Refresh your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin-ui/

2. Look at your Django server terminal (where you ran "runserver")

You should see logs like:
   🔍 API called: /admin-ui/api/cases/
   📊 Firebase service: <FirebaseService object>
   🔎 Fetching cases from Firebase...
   📋 Found case: YS7QBc1zyf06b...

OR if there's an error:
   ❌ No Firebase service!
   ❌ Error: [error message]

---

Please copy and paste what appears in the Django terminal when you refresh the dashboard!
